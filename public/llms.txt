## Mission
E4 Youth uses storytelling to unlock equity and opportunity across generations, building workforce pathways through creative technology and community engagement.

## The E4 Ecosystem Model
The E4 Ecosystem is E4 Youth's circular development model with four interconnected stages:

1. **Engage** — Community entry points through public experiences, events, and cultural programming that welcome participants into the ecosystem.
2. **Educate** — Structured learning experiences in digital media, storytelling, and creative technology that build foundational skills.
3. **Empower** — Applied projects and professional experiences where participants create real work, build portfolios, and develop career-ready competencies.
4. **Elevate** — Workforce placement, leadership roles, and alumni pathways that create lasting economic impact and community contribution.

The model is circular: participants who Elevate return to Engage the next generation, creating sustainable community impact.
