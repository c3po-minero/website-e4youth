## Why This Work Matters Section
**Heading:** Beyond Self-Expression: Storytelling as Infrastructure
**Icon:** `fa-bridge-circle-check`

Traditional youth programs often separate "soft skills" from "hard skills," treating creativity as enrichment rather than foundation. E4 Youth recognizes that storytelling is actually workforce and civic infrastructure—a core competency that drives success across industries and life experiences.

When young people learn to document their histories, articulate their values, and share their perspectives using professional digital tools, they're not just being creative. They're developing:

- **Communication mastery** that serves them in interviews, presentations, and leadership roles
- **Technical fluency** with industry-standard creative and digital tools  
- **Professional portfolios** that demonstrate both skills and authentic perspective
- **Network connections** with mentors, peers, and community leaders
- **Civic engagement** skills that strengthen their communities
