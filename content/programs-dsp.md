## FAQ Section
**Heading:** Questions Families Often Ask
**Icon:** `fa-circle-question`

**Q: What if my child isn't interested in technology?**

A: We encourage family participation but understand busy schedules. At minimum, we ask for parent/caregiver involvement in the first and last sessions, plus the community showcase.

**Q: What if we don't have computers or tablets at home?**
A: All necessary equipment is provided during sessions. We also have a limited lending library of devices families can borrow for home use during the program.

**Q: Can my child continue with E4 Youth after DSP?**
A: Absolutely! DSP is designed as an entry point to our programs. Many participants continue with Get Creative! as they enter middle and high school.

**Q: What if my child has learning differences or needs accommodations?**
A: We welcome all learners and work with families to ensure every child can participate fully. Please discuss your child's needs during the initial conversation so we can plan appropriate support.
