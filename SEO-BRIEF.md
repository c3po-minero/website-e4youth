## 5. Internal Linking Strategy

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

```
                    HOME
                   / | \
          Ecosystem  Experiences  Impact
              |      /  |  \        |
              +-- DSP  WOW  AR  ---+
                   \   |   /
                   Stories
```

### Linking Rules

1. **Every page** links to the 4E Ecosystem page (footer or inline CTA)
2. **Ecosystem page** links to each Experience that maps to its quadrant
3. **Experience detail pages** link to:
   - Experiences hub (breadcrumb)
   - Related experiences (sidebar: "Also in the Educate stage")
   - Relevant stories (embedded Elevate Proof tiles)
   - Partner page (CTA: "Employers: partner with us")
4. **Impact page** links to experiences within each metric section
5. **Stories** link back to the experience they came from
6. **Partner page** links to Impact (proof) and Ecosystem (framework)
7. **Breadcrumbs** on all pages: `Home > Experiences > [Program Name]`

### Anchor Text Guidelines

- Use keyword-rich anchor text: "youth workforce opportunity" not "click here"
- Vary anchors naturally — don't repeat exact match on every link
- Cross-link between 4E stages: "After Get Creative, many youth move into WOW"

## 7. Additional SEO Notes

### Compensation Language
All pages must use **"stipend-supported + employer-funded (expanding)"** — never dollar amounts. This applies to meta descriptions, body copy, and schema `offers`.

### Rename Checklist
Search codebase for all instances of "Jacob Fontaine" and replace with "AR Heritage Tours":
- Page titles, meta tags, body copy, alt text, filenames, URLs, nav menus, sitemaps

### Image SEO
- Alt text pattern: `"[descriptive scene] — E4Youth [program name] in Austin, TX"`
- Hero images: silent, multi-generational imagery — alt text should reflect this
- Compress all images; use Next.js `<Image>` with responsive sizes

### Technical SEO
- Implement `next-sitemap` with all new URLs
- Add `robots.txt` allowing all crawlers
- Canonical URLs on all pages
- Open Graph + Twitter Card meta for all pages
- 301 redirects from old `/programs/*` to `/experiences/*`
- Page speed: target Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)

### Content Priorities (Implementation Order)
1. Home (highest traffic entry point)
2. Experiences hub + detail pages (core content)
3. 4E Ecosystem (differentiator)
4. Impact (conversion support)
5. Partner (lead generation)
6. Stories (ongoing content)
