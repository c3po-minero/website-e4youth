**Meta Title:** E4Youth — Youth Workforce Development Through Creative Technology | Austin TX
**Meta Description:** E4Youth builds multi-generational pathways through creative technology. Engage, Educate, Empower, Elevate — stipend-supported experiences for young people in Austin, TX.

---

### Section 1: Hero

**H1:** Building Futures Through Creative Technology
**Subheadline:** From grandparents sharing oral histories to young professionals leading AR tours — E4Youth creates pathways where communities and emerging creatives explore identity, build digital literacy, and translate their stories into skills, portfolios, and career-connected opportunities.

**Primary CTA:** Join an Experience → `/contact`
**Secondary CTA:** Partner With Us → `/partner`

> **Design note:** Hero imagery should be silent, multi-generational — elders and youth together, not just teens. The first frame a visitor sees must communicate "across generations."

---

### Section 2: Our Mission

**Tag:** Our Mission

**Body:**
E4Youth uses the power of storytelling to unlock equity and opportunity across generations. We create spaces where communities and emerging creatives can explore identity, build digital literacy, and translate their stories into skills, portfolios, and career-connected opportunities.

Through immersive workshops, oral history projects, and interactive experiences, E4Youth equips participants to be seen, heard, and hired — not only as job seekers, but as cultural innovators and emerging professionals. Our work spans generations: young people learn from elders, communities shape curriculum, and alumni return as mentors and leaders.

---

### Section 3: The 4E Ecosystem (Circle)

**Tag:** Our Model
**H2:** The 4E Ecosystem
**Body:** Every E4Youth experience is part of a connected cycle. Four stages — Engage, Educate, Empower, and Elevate — create a living ecosystem where young people grow, contribute, and come back to lift others.

> **Design note:** Interactive circular graphic showing the four stages as a continuous loop. Each quadrant is clickable/tappable. The circle should visually communicate that Elevate feeds back into Engage.

#### Quadrant Cards (brief, linking to `/ecosystem`):

**Engage**
Meeting young people and families where they are — through public events, AR heritage tours, and community storytelling.

**Educate**
Building digital literacy, creative confidence, and professional skills through structured, stipend-supported learning experiences.

**Empower**
Creating real work with real audiences — portfolios, exhibitions, public installations, and employer-connected projects.

**Elevate**
Stepping into leadership, earning opportunity, and returning to strengthen the ecosystem that built you.

**CTA:** Explore the Full 4E Ecosystem → `/ecosystem`

### Section 4: Elevate Proof — Where This Leads

**Tag:** Elevate Proof
**H2:** Where This Leads

**Body:** The 4E Ecosystem isn't a theory. These are real outcomes from real people who moved through our programs and stepped into something bigger.

#### Story Tile 1
- **Title:** From Workshop to Heritage Guide
- **Description:** A DSP participant who started as a 10th grader documenting family stories now leads AR Heritage Tours as a stipend-supported facilitator — teaching visitors and younger participants alike.
- **Tag:** Elevate · AR Heritage Tours

#### Story Tile 2
- **Title:** Portfolio to Paycheck
- **Description:** After building a creative portfolio through Get Creative and HIP, one participant landed a paid position with a local media company — their E4Youth work served as their résumé.
- **Tag:** Elevate · Workforce

#### Story Tile 3
- **Title:** Community Historian at 19
- **Description:** A Heritage Innovation Pathways participant went from collecting oral histories to presenting original research at a regional conference — then came back to mentor the next cohort.
- **Tag:** Elevate · Leadership

#### Story Tile 4
- **Title:** Mentor, Then Manager
- **Description:** An early E4Youth participant returned as a program mentor during college, then transitioned into a part-time staff role helping shape the next generation of programming.
- **Tag:** Elevate · Full Circle

---

### Section 5: Built Across Generations

**H2:** Built Across Generations

**Body:**
E4Youth didn't start in a boardroom. It started in community — with elders sharing stories, young people picking up cameras, and families asking what it would look like to preserve their history and build careers at the same time.

Today, that question drives everything we do. Grandparents sit beside grandchildren in our workshops. Alumni return as mentors. Community historians co-design curriculum with technologists. This is multi-generational work — not as a tagline, but as a practice.

**H3:** Community Roots
Our programs are built in Austin, TX, rooted in the cultural traditions and neighborhoods that shaped them. Every experience we offer connects to a living community — not an abstract audience.

**H3:** Multi-Generational Impact
When a young person documents an elder's story, both are changed. When that story becomes a public AR experience, the whole community benefits. And when that young person grows into a professional who returns to teach — the circle is complete.

---

### Section 6: CTA Banner

**H2:** Ready to Make an Impact?
**Body:** Whether you are a young creative, educator, funder, or community partner, there is a place for you at E4Youth.

## 4E ECOSYSTEM PAGE

**URL:** `/ecosystem` *(NEW PAGE)*

**Meta Title:** The 4E Ecosystem — Engage, Educate, Empower, Elevate | E4Youth
**Meta Description:** Discover E4Youth's circular development model. Four stages — Engage, Educate, Empower, Elevate — create lasting workforce pathways through creative technology and community storytelling.

---

### Section 1: Hero

**H1:** The 4E Ecosystem — Engage, Educate, Empower, Elevate

**Subheadline:** Not a pipeline. A circle. E4Youth's ecosystem is built so young people can enter at any point, grow through creative technology, and return to strengthen the community that invested in them.

**Primary CTA:** See Our Experiences → `/experiences`
**Secondary CTA:** Partner With Us → `/partner`

---

### Section 2: The Model (Visual Intro)

**Body:**
Most workforce programs move in a straight line: train, place, done. E4Youth works differently. Our 4E Ecosystem is circular — each stage feeds the next, and the final stage, Elevate, feeds right back into Engage.

This means the young person who once attended a community event as a curious 8th grader can return years later as a mentor, facilitator, or professional — bringing new participants into the same ecosystem that shaped them.

Every E4Youth experience maps to one or more of these stages. Together, they create a living system that grows stronger with each generation.

> **Design note:** Large, animated circle graphic showing the four quadrants with directional flow. Elevate quadrant slightly larger or visually emphasized (glow, weight, or size). Arrow from Elevate loops back to Engage.

---

### Section 3: Engage — Discover Your Creative Voice

**H2:** Engage — Discover Your Creative Voice

**Body:**
Engage is the front door. It's the first time a young person or family encounters E4Youth — at a community event, an AR Heritage Tour, or a live showcase. No applications, no prerequisites. Just come as you are.

Engage experiences are designed to spark curiosity, build trust, and connect people to their own stories and communities. For many participants, this is where the journey begins.

**Key Experiences:**
- AR Heritage Tours — Public, youth-created augmented reality tours of Austin's cultural history
- E4 Live — Community networking events celebrating creativity and connection
- Community Showcases — Public exhibitions of youth work and storytelling projects

**H3: Where This Can Lead**

**Story Tile:**
- **Title:** Curiosity to Commitment
- **Description:** A family attended an AR Heritage Tour during a neighborhood festival. Their daughter was fascinated by the technology and the stories. Three months later, she enrolled in the Digital Storytelling Program — and hasn't stopped creating since.
- **Tag:** Engage → Educate

---

### Section 4: Educate — Build Skills Through Technology

**H2:** Educate — Build Skills Through Technology

**Body:**
Educate is where curiosity becomes capability. Through structured, stipend-supported programs, participants build real skills — digital storytelling, creative production, oral history methods, and professional communication. Every program pairs technical training with cultural grounding, so young people learn not just how to use tools but why their stories matter.

Educate experiences are age-appropriate and progressive: younger participants build foundational literacy, while older participants develop portfolio-ready work and professional skills.

**Key Experiences:**
- Digital Storytelling Program (DSP) — Storytelling, digital literacy, and creative expression for school-aged youth and families
- Get Creative — Career exploration connecting storytelling and digital skills to creative and tech pathways (high school)
- Heritage Innovation Pathways (HIP) — Community history, storytelling, and emerging technology for college-aged participants

**Compensation:** All Educate experiences are stipend-supported.

**H3: Where This Can Lead**

**Story Tile:**
- **Title:** Skills That Transfer
- **Description:** A Get Creative participant used the video production and digital design skills she built in the program to land a summer internship at a local creative agency — before she'd even graduated high school.
- **Tag:** Educate → Empower

---

### Section 5: Empower — Create Real Work, Real Impact

**H2:** Empower — Create Real Work, Real Impact

**Body:**
Empower is where participants stop practicing and start producing. Their work goes public — through exhibitions, digital platforms, employer-connected projects, and community installations. This is real work for real audiences, and it builds the kind of portfolio and professional experience that opens doors.

At the Empower stage, participants also begin to take on leadership roles within E4Youth — mentoring newer participants, facilitating workshops, and co-designing programming. The work they produce has value beyond the classroom.

**Key Experiences:**
- What Once Was (WOW) — Public storytelling platform elevating participant work into exhibitions, digital experiences, and public space
- WOW Heritage Center — Physical, place-based hub for storytelling, learning, and community connection
- Workforce Opportunities — Stipend-supported + employer-funded (expanding) positions connecting skills to careers

**Compensation:** Empower experiences are stipend-supported + employer-funded (expanding).

**H3: Where This Can Lead**

**Story Tile:**
- **Title:** From Student Project to Public Installation
- **Description:** A team of HIP participants created an interactive heritage installation that was featured at the WOW Heritage Center for three months — visited by hundreds of community members and cited by a local news outlet.
- **Tag:** Empower → Elevate

---

### Section 6: Elevate — Lead, Earn, Transform

**H2:** Elevate — Lead, Earn, Transform

> **Design note:** This section should carry slightly more visual weight — a different background color, larger type, or a subtle glow/highlight to communicate that Elevate is the culmination.

**Body:**
Elevate is where it all comes together. Participants at this stage aren't just beneficiaries — they're leaders, earners, and ecosystem builders. They hold professional roles, lead programs, mentor peers, and carry forward the cultural knowledge and technical skills they've built.

But Elevate isn't the end. It's where the circle closes and reopens. Elevated participants become the mentors, facilitators, and community leaders who bring new people into the Engage stage. They hire from the ecosystem. They advocate for the work. They are the proof that the model works.

**Key Experiences:**
- E4 Level Up — Advanced professional development for college-aged, early-career, and established creatives
- Alumni Leadership — Returning participants in mentorship, facilitation, and staff roles
- Employer Pathways — Career placements and professional opportunities through E4Youth's partner network

**Compensation:** Elevate roles are employer-funded, with expanding opportunities.

**H3: Where This Can Lead**

**Story Tile:**
- **Title:** The Circle Completes
- **Description:** One of E4Youth's earliest participants — who started in DSP as a high schooler — now works part-time on staff, co-designs curriculum for new cohorts, and mentors youth who remind him of where he started. His career in creative media began here. His impact continues here.
- **Tag:** Elevate → Engage

---

### Section 7: The Circle Continues

**H2:** The Circle Continues

**Body:**
The 4E Ecosystem isn't a one-time journey. It's a living system that strengthens with each participant, each cohort, each generation. When someone reaches the Elevate stage and comes back to invest in others, the whole ecosystem grows.

This is what makes E4Youth different. We don't graduate people out. We build them in.

## Implementation Notes

### Global Changes
1. **Rename all instances** of "Jacob Fontaine AR Tours" / "Jacob Fontaine AR Tour" → "AR Heritage Tours" across all pages, components, navigation, and metadata
2. **URL redirects:** `/programs/*` → `/experiences/*`; any "jacob-fontaine" URLs → `/experiences/ar-heritage-tours`
3. **Navigation update:** "Programs" → "Experiences"; add "4E Ecosystem" as a nav item
4. **Footer:** Add link to `/ecosystem` on every page
5. **Compensation language:** Always use "stipend-supported + employer-funded (expanding)" — never dollar amounts

### Cross-Linking
- Every page should link to `/ecosystem` at least once
- Elevate Proof tiles appear on: Home, Impact, Stories, and individual experience pages
- Experience detail pages should note their 4E stage and link to related experiences in the same or adjacent stages
- Stories link back to the experience they reference

### Elevate Story Tiles (Reusable Component)
Create a reusable `ElevateProofTile` component with:

These tiles appear across multiple pages and should be consistent in design.

### 4E Stage Badges
Create a small badge/tag component showing the 4E stage (Engage, Educate, Empower, Elevate) with corresponding colors:
- Engage: `#4DB8FF`
- Educate: `#9B51E0`
- Empower: `#FCB900`
- Elevate: `#7BDCB5`

Use these on experience cards, story tiles, impact sections, and partner cards.
